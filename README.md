# Tier 2 Week 7 Weekend Challenge: Salary Calculator

For this challenge, we will create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs.

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

The application should have an input form that collects an employee's _first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button should collect the input information from the form, store the information, using the stored information to calculate the total monthly costs, append this information to the DOM in table format, and clear the input fields. If the total monthly costs exceeds \$20,000, a red background color is added to the total monthly cost.

In addition, create a 'Delete' button for each employee added. This button removes the employee from the DOM and also remove the employ's salary from the reported total.
